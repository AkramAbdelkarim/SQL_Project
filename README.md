- **PostgreSQL**: The chosen Database management system, ideal for handling the job postings data and complex queries. 
- **Visual Studio Code**: IDE used for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Gi & Github**: Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tackling.
